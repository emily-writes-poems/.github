![Emily Writes Poems. A collection of my poems.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emily-writes-poems/.github/main/profile/images/ewp-header.png)

## What's this project?
A webapp displaying the text and details of my poetry.


## The technical stuff
* Most of the application is in [this repo](https://github.com/emily-writes-poems/emily-writes-poems-frontend). It's built using the MERN stack:
    * M: MongoDB (set up and populated with poems!)
    * E: Express.js (backend routing)
    * R: React (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
    * N: Node.js (also with Create React App)
* I am using Python (with PyMongo) scripts for updating the database of poems. More on that in [this repo](https://www.github.com/emily-writes-poems/emily-writes-poems-scripts).
* The webapp is hosted on Heroku, so there may a ~30 second delay in fetching the site initially.
